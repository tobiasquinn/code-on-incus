"""
In-workspace Claude Code project settings must be read-only inside the container
when the protection is enabled.

`.claude/settings.json` (and `.claude/settings.local.json`) can carry a "hooks"
key — shell commands Claude auto-executes when it opens the repo. The workspace
is mounted read-write and persists to the host, so a contained agent that could
write those files could plant a hook that a *later* session — another COI
container, or a native `claude` run on the host — would auto-execute on open. That
is a containment escape (the contained agent gets code execution in a context it
should not). COI mounts those files read-only (protected_paths) so the agent
cannot tamper with them. The protection is opt-out, but only from trusted-scope
config (`security.writable_paths`) — an untrusted project `.coi/config.toml`
cannot remove it.

This fork runs opencode/pi only, so the claude/codex settings files are NOT in
the default protected_paths (nothing here consumes them). These tests therefore
enable the protection explicitly via trusted-scope `additional_protected_paths`
($COI_CONFIG) and verify the mechanism itself still works end to end.
